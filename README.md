#Minesweeper Game
A minesweeper game created in C++ and SFML
Created by Ord-Com
There is also a command line version available!

##Installation
- For CLI version, it is as follows
```shell
git clone __link__
```
Then got to the directory of the game and run main.cpp, alternatively, you can directly type the command for it on the terminal/console
- For GUI version
    - there are two options here, whether to install as an application (using cmake)
    - or to play by running the codes

##Requirements
- for CLI version, the only requirement is a C++ compiler, (use clang or g++)
- for the GUI version, it would be nice to have sfml installed for running if you are using from codes. Visit the sfml website for instructions on how to install and configure it on your system. We are currently working on an installer for the game, until then,  this is the way XD.
