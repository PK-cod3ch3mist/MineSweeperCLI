# Minesweeper Game
A minesweeper game created in C++

## Installation
Clone the repository.
```shell
git clone https://github.com/PK-cod3ch3mist/MineSweeperCLI.git
```
Then go to the directory of the game and run main.cpp, alternatively, you can directly type the command for it on the terminal/console

## Requirements
All you need is a C++ compiler. If you are a macOS user, the executable inside the bin folder will work directly though.

ANSI escape sequence support will be good, otherwise you won't be able to see colours well. 

## Gameplay
All instructions will be there in the game.
